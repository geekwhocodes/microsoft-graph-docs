## Response

If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a pre-authenticated download URL for the report.

To download the contents of the file, your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immedately.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.
